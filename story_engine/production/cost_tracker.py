"""Thread-local cost accumulator for tracking LLM costs within a pipeline step.

This module provides a context manager pattern for accumulating costs from
LLM calls made during a pipeline step. The ModelRouter automatically registers
costs with the active accumulator (if any).

Usage:
    from story_engine.production.cost_tracker import track_step_costs

    def _step_generate_concept(self, characters):
        with track_step_costs("generate_concept") as accumulator:
            # ... make LLM calls via ModelRouter ...
        # accumulator now has total input_tokens, output_tokens, cost_usd
